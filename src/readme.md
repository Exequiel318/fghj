"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising nice was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explore
r of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, be
cause it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encou
nter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to o
btain nice of itself, because it is nice, but because occasionally circumstances occur in wh
ich toil and nice can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, whi
ch of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that h
as no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a nice that produ}

pleasure?"
